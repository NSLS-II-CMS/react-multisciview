 * A name of a attribute is defined by a sequence of tokens.
 * For example, it looks like metadata_extract.data.annealing_time where
 * metadata_extract and data are related protocols defined by scientists or
 * generated during database construction, and annealing_time is the actual 
 * attribute name. As the attribute name is not unique (i.e. same attributes under
 * different protocols), we keep those prefix with the maximum length defined below.
